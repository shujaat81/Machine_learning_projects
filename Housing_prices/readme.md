# Housing Prices Prediction
In this 'simple linear reggression model', we are building a mathematical model using python to minimize the cost/error function by using gradient descent(No external library is used).

# Prerequisites

To understand the model you should have following Prerequisites:
1. Mathematical intuition for gradient descent, cost/error function, line of best fit( y= mx + b).
2. Good understanding of python syntax.
3. concept of simple linear reggression for supervised learning.

# Platform
The following code for model has been tested on spyder, you just have to pull out the code and start calculating cost function before and after the training of dataset you have, run the gradient descent runner with no of iterations , finally you can use new values after training on your data for predicting housing prices.

# Built With
Anaconda
Spyder
